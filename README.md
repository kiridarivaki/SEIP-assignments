### SkillSync 
- **Directory structure**
<p>
skillsync
    └─── src───main
         │      ├───python
         │      │   └───source code files
         │      └───scripts
         │   
         └───unittest
            ├───python
            └───test files
        
</p>

- **Build automation tool**
<p>Used pybuild to automate the building and testing process. Challenges I tackled in this step included setting up a venv for my python project, setting PYTHONPATH, specifying import absolute paths and overriding plugin's coverage restrictions for building the app. </p>
